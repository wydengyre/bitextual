            <h2>This tutorial teaches you to create a bilingual book from two epub files</h2>
        </hgroup>

        <p>Following the three steps below, we'll generate a bilingual, parallel,
        French-English version of Madame Bovary.
        By following these steps but substituting your own epub files, you
        can create bilingual versions of whatever book you want!</p>

        <h3>Step 1: download the epub files</h3>

        <p>We'll get both epubs from Project Gutenberg. Visit pages for the
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14155">French version</a> and the
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2413">English version</a>. On both
        pages, click to download both EPub files to your computer. Both EPUB and EPUB3 versions
        will work fine.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: enter the epub files</h3>

        <p>Head to <a href="../">bitextual.net</a>. In the left-side, source pane, click the button
        to import the French epub you downloaded. On the right-side, import the English epub.</p>

        <p>Note that both epubs contained a bit of "fluff" at the beginning: notes about the book,
        table of contents, etc. In our case, this won't mess with alignment, but if you're importing
        a <em>different</em> epub, you might want to manually delete this "fluff" so that both copies start
        at the exact same point, be it a prolog, or first chapter, etc. This especially applies when the
        translated version might have a lengthy, special introduction.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Create the bilingual alignment</h3>

        <p>Click the big blue "generate" button. After a brief loading pause, you have a bilingual book! It
        will be similar to the <a href="../bovary.aligned">example</a>.</p>

        <p>You can save your book using your browser's "save as" or "save page as", in its File menu.</p>

        <p>Note that Bitextual is still very much an early beta product, with limited language support. It also
        has a tendency to screw up alignment on "liberally" translated text. For an example, see the
        <a href="../marianela.aligned">alignment of Marianela</a>. We're working on it!</p>

        <h3>Rejoice!</h3>

        <p><em>And that's all!</em> While we work out the kinks, we're happy to have your
            <a href="../feedback/">feedback</a>.</p>
